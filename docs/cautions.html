<h3>Cautions for Chi-sqare periodogram using high resolution time series data!</h3>
<p>Before you apply chi-sqare periodogram to a high resolution time serise data, we would like to show you the effects of smoothing functions the in analysis.</p>

<p>As an example, we analyze a free-running rhythm of a fly activity in constant darkness. The data were collected with 1 min-bins.<p>

<p>If we apply chi-sqare periodogram to this data without any smoothing, the periodogram displays a peak at 1425 min above a significant line (red line) with many small and sharp peaks over the graph.</p>

<p>This significant peak can be pronounced by smoothing the data, by which the noise peaks are diminished. In the next periodogram, we smoothed the data by a Gaussian kernel. As you see, the significant peak is now very high.</p>

<p>A similar effect can be achieved by changing the step size. Here we tranform 1 min data to 6 min data. A problem is that the resolution of the periodogram is also reduced, because the resolution of the chi-sqare periodogram analysis depends on the resolution of the data.</p>

<p>If you compare all periodograms, you will see that smoothing influences the power of the peak very much.</p>
