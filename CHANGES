Version v0.6:
-------------
* Fix an error which occurred sometimes when zooming in.
* Draw line numbers in the actograms.
* Draw a title for each actogram.
* The default number of indicated peaks in periodograms is now 1.
* Allow for optional downsampling before calculating periodograms.
* Replace "_convolved" with "_smoothed" in the name of calculated actograms.
* Fix an error in writing text to Pdfs.
* The jar archive contains now the source code.

Version v0.5:
-------------
* In the average activity pattern dialog, use a default sigma of 0.
* In the average activity pattern dialog, take the interval duration into
  account when calculating the default period.
* Same for the periodogram dialog.
* In the periodogram dialog, narrow the lower and upper period limits
  for faster computation.
* Periodograms: Use gaussian smoothing instead of downsampling.

Version v0.4:
-------------
* Fix the calculation of p values in the periodograms. For the Fourier method,
  p values are disabled because they would require the periodogram to be
  calculated for all possible period lengths, which in general takes too long
  to calculate.
* For other types of periodograms, the user can now specify the p value level.
* Fix axis calibration in the periodogram diagrams.
* In the "Open" dialog, the input fields "number of rows" and "number of
  columns" are replaced by "end row" and "end column".
* Fix some problems with zooming.
* Implement the calculation of average activity patterns.


Version v0.3:
-------------
* Make preview table in the 'Open' dialog capable of reading lines with a
  different number of columns.
* Introduce three modes for pointing, selecting and manual determination of
  the freerunning period.
* Implement generic drawing to do screen and pdf rendering with the same code.
* Allow to change the ratio w:h of an actogram.
* Introduce environmental bars for light, temperature, etc.
* Automatic determination of the freerunning period with the Fourier, Chi-Square
  (Enright) and Lomb-Scargle methods.
* Simplify the 'Calculate' window.
* Fix wrong sorting for multiple selected actograms.
* Adjustable units for the freerunning period string.
* Introduce zoom out.
* Allow to open several actogram files with the same parameters simultaneously.
* Add a menu bar.
* Implement normalizing of multiple actograms to the same overall activity.
* Add documentation.


Version v0.2:
-------------
* Calibration bar with adjustable number of subdivisions
  The number of subdivisions can be adjusted by clicking on the
  'Preferences' icon.
* Allow to remove files from the display by right-clicking.
* 'Freerunning period' is in black now.
* In the 'Preferences' dialog, 'number of periods per line' is changed to
  'number of plots'.
* Simple calculations of actograms, invoked by clicking on the 'Calculate' icon.
  - Summing or averaging the displayed/selected actograms.
  - Smoothing individual actograms.
  The results of the calculations are displayed under the tree entry
  'Calculated'.
* The preview table in the open dialog does not crash any more when
  the file to open contains plain text at the beginning.
* Fix the constant shift at the beginning of the actograms.


Version v0.1:
-------------
* First public version.
